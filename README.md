# CLapacke-Linux

`CLapacke-Linux` is a Swift package for Linux (Ubuntu) that allows you to link against [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) library.

This package is a wrapper around [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) so you have to install it before hand:

```
sudo apt-get install liblapacke-dev
```
